The printf project is a collaboration between Muoneke Christopher and Akee Adeola, students of Software Engineering at ALX.

This function named "_printf()" imitates the actual "printf()" command located in the stdio.h library of C programming Language. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of "printf".
